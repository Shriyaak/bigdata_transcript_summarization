MTHS4005 Lecture 3 - transcript Summary
So going back to the example we had before where A was just the even numbers two for six and b was 3 or 6 and divisible by three, the probability of at least one of these occurring is not going to be the probability of a plus the probability of B, because what we have is we have some overlap which essentially results in double counting. And we have additivity if and b two disjointed events also known as mutually exclusive, then the probability of a or b occurring is just the probability of a plus probability of B. So going back to our earlier discussion of measures, axioms a1, a2, a3, essentially shared by all measures. If A is a subset of B, then the probability of A occurring is less than or equal to the probability of B. So in other words, if I'm interested in the total weight of everybody in in this lecture theatre, well that's going to be greater than the total weight of everybody in the front row, because the goes in the front row is just a subset of the whole. This is going to be the probability of A plus the probability of b minus the probability of the intersection. So here, if we want the probability black or king probability black, plus the probability of the king minus the ones we counted twice, which will be the white case.
